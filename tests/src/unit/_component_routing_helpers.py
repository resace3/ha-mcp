"""Shared WS-mock scaffolding for the ``ha_mcp_tools`` component routing tests.

The four routing suites (``test_ha_search_component_routing`` /
``test_ha_overview_component_routing`` / ``test_config_get_component_routing`` /
``test_ha_config_list_helpers_component_routing``) and the cross-seam
``test_component_readapi_contract`` all mock the same two moving parts: a WS
client whose ``send_command`` dispatches on the command type (``ha_mcp_tools/info``
for the caps probe plus one read command), and the ``get_websocket_client``
factory each tool resolves that WS through. This module owns both so the shape of
the mock lives in one place; each suite keeps its own ``RoutingClient`` spy,
which encodes the per-tool legacy-fetch surface and is deliberately NOT shared.
