"""Unit tests for the deep_search scene branch's Phase-2.5 entity-registry
augmentation and partial-failure surfacing.

Phase 2.5 covers the case where HA derives a scene's entity_id from its
``name`` slug rather than its storage key — bulk-fetched configs are
keyed by the storage key, so Phase 3 lookup via entity-id slug would
miss them without the registry-driven alias step.

The partial-failure surfacing covers Boy-Scout finding from PR #1168
review: when the Attempt-C per-id fetch hits the wall-clock budget or
records per-id failures, the response now carries ``partial: True``
and a ``partial_reason`` so callers can distinguish "no scene matched"
from "matches may be missing".
