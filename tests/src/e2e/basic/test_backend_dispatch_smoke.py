"""Multi-layer smoke tests for backend dispatch correctness.

The three e2e CI lanes set env vars that ``conftest.ha_container_with_fresh_config``
reads to choose a backend:

| Lane                          | HAOS_TEST_IMAGE_PATH | HAOS_TEST_MODE | expected backend |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| e2e-tests.yml (testcontainer) | unset                | unset          | ``container``    |
| haos-e2e-tests.yml (external) | set                  | unset          | ``haos``         |
| haos-e2e-inaddon-tests.yml    | set                  | ``inaddon``    | ``haos_inaddon`` |
| haos-e2e-embedded-tests.yml   | set                  | ``embedded``   | ``haos_embedded``|

The testcontainer ``embedded`` backend (#1527) is a fourth variant selected by a
separate axis, ``E2E_BACKEND=embedded`` (not ``HAOS_TEST_MODE``): same container
HA, but the server-under-test is the in-process MCP server entry inside
the container.

Three layers of guard, each catching a different silent-failure mode:

1. ``test_backend_dispatch_matches_workflow_env`` — asserts the ``backend``
   field that conftest sets matches what the workflow env vars imply.
   Catches dispatch falling through to the wrong code path.

2. ``test_supervisor_addon_tool_behavior_matches_backend`` — calls
   ``ha_get_addon`` (which only works when a real Supervisor is present)
   and asserts success-vs-failure matches the claimed backend. Catches
   the case where conftest reports ``backend=X`` but actually a different
   HA instance is running (e.g. mock Supervisor on testcontainer making
   addon calls succeed when the real backend has no Supervisor at all,
   or HAOS reporting itself as container).

3. ``test_session_collected_test_count_above_floor`` — asserts the
   session collected at least the baseline number of tests. Catches
   collection-time regressions where a test file fails to import and
   pytest silently drops tens of tests.

4. ``test_session_skipped_count_below_ceiling`` — per-lane skip-count
   ceiling. Catches the inverse of #3: collection size unchanged but
   tests transition pass→skip silently because a marker was applied
   too broadly. The conftest documents a prior incident of this kind
   (PR #1375 audit, 14 ``supervisor_mock`` tests silently skipping on
   every testcontainer run — see the PR #1375 audit comment in ``tests/src/e2e/conftest.py``).

This file is placed under ``basic/`` (NOT ``haos_only/``) on purpose: the
auto-applied ``haos_only`` marker would skip these whenever
``is_haos_backend_selected()`` returns False, which is exactly the
silent-failure case we want to catch. ``basic/`` has no auto-applied
markers so the tests run unconditionally on every lane.
