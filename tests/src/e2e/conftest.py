"""
Testcontainers integration for E2E testing.

Spins up an isolated Home Assistant Docker container for each test session.
Tests MUST run against this container — never against a real HA instance.

Environment Variables:
    HA_TEST_PORT: Optional fixed port for HA container (default: dynamic).
                  Example: HA_TEST_PORT=8124

NOTE: config.py loads HOMEASSISTANT_URL from the .env.test file at import
time, so checking os.environ for a pre-set URL is not a reliable guard here.
Protection against accidental real-HA usage is instead ensured by:
  - Guard 1: Docker must be available (testcontainers requirement)
  - Guard 3: HA API must become ready within 60s (container health check)
  - AGENTS.md: documents correct test-run commands

    1. Seed the server config entry with the stable webhook id/secret (so the

    entries fields are sentinel zeros rather than real data.

    HA Core's ``APICoreStateView`` (``homeassistant/components/api/__init__.py``)
    is the documented Supervisor-facing readiness endpoint: it reports the
    ``CoreState`` enum value, which only transitions to ``"RUNNING"`` once
    every integration's ``async_setup_entry`` has been dispatched (or hit
    the 300s ``SLOW_SETUP_MAX_WAIT`` per-domain timeout from
    ``homeassistant/setup.py``). ``/api/`` 200 by contrast is HA's
    liveness signal — the HTTP component finishes setup early in bootstrap,
    before most integrations.

    Background (#366 thread, Ilya0527 2026-05-18): polling ``/api/`` then
    counting components / entities / services across separate gates was
    racing ``async_setup_entry`` for slow integrations. This helper
    replaces five such gates with a single ``CoreState.RUNNING`` check.
    A tight ``sun.sun`` state poll is still kept inline at the call site
    because sun's first periodic position computation runs as a scheduled
    task after ``async_setup_entry`` returns, so ``RUNNING`` does not
    strictly imply ``sun.sun != "unknown"``.

    Also captures ``/api/config/config_entries/entry`` at the trip moment
    via ``_snapshot_config_entries`` to emit ``entries_loaded`` /
    ``entries_total`` alongside the success signal. The post-merge data
    window then verifies that ``RUNNING`` actually closes the race: any
    run where ``entries_loaded < entries_total`` at trip time means a
    slow integration finished its ``async_setup_entry`` after
    ``CoreState.RUNNING`` was set, and a follow-up gate would be
    justified.

    packaging regressions (e.g. skills missing from the installed
    package — #1280), entry-point startup failures, and JSON
    serialization issues. Without this fixture, stdio-only regressions
