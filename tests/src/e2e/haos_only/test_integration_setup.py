"""HAOS-only integration setup coverage (issue #1349 item 2).

These tests verify integration surfaces that the testcontainer tier physically
cannot reach because they depend on either (a) HA's real Sun-position math
(the testcontainer stub returns static values from a frozen world clock), or
(b) a Supervisor-backed HA to drive the Local Calendar config-entry lifecycle
end to end.

Layout:

* Sun integration's ``sun.sun`` exposes realistic next_dawn / next_dusk
  attributes within 24h of the test-process clock.
* Local Calendar config-entry lifecycle: create entry → entity registers →
  add event → retrieve event → tear down the config entry.

(The ESPHome / Node-RED companion-integration tests this module originally
held were deleted — see the NOTE below.)

All tests are marker-gated to the HAOS backend and run without ``pytest.skip``;
absent fixtures fail loudly.
