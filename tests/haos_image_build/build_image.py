"""Build the HAOS test image used by the HAOS E2E tier (#1281).

The script boots a vanilla HAOS qcow2 inside QEMU/KVM, runs first-user
onboarding to obtain a long-lived access token, registers the ha-mcp addon
repository, installs the addons listed in ``ADDONS``, performs the HACS
bootstrap, then powers HAOS off and emits an uncompressed qcow2 image.

Invoke from a Linux host with /dev/kvm available — both the local developer
flow and the build-haos-test-image.yml workflow follow the same path. The
build's own output is the uncompressed ``<work-dir>/haos-test-image.qcow2``;
the workflow then compresses it, uploads it as an artifact, and (on master)
primes the shared Actions cache that the e2e lanes restore.

    """Install the local webhook-proxy addon during the bake's running phase.

    Assumes ``stage_webhook_proxy_addon_source`` ran before start_qemu so
    the source is at ``/supervisor/addons/local/ha_mcp_webhook_proxy/``.

    Install-only — the addon is NOT started during bake and ``boot`` is
    set to ``manual`` so the cached qcow2 doesn't auto-start it on
    resume. Two reasons:

    1. ``start.py`` overwrites ``/config/.mcp_proxy_config.json`` on
       every run with target_url + the addon's persisted webhook_id
       (``/data/webhook_id.txt`` — generated on first-ever start,
       reused on every subsequent run). The persisted id differs from
       the deterministic value the bake injected via
       ``bake_test_state``. If the addon runs during bake or on
       resume, the overwrite clobbers the deterministic config and
       breaks sibling tests that rely on the bake's webhook_id
       (``test_webhook_proxy.py`` in particular).
    2. On resume, the dev MCP addon and the webhook-proxy both
       auto-start in parallel; webhook-proxy's auto-discovery races
       the dev addon's startup and fails on first attempt, then
       Supervisor escalates to ``boot_fail`` before the dev addon is
       ready.

    A session-scoped pytest fixture in
    ``tests/src/e2e/haos_only/test_webhook_proxy_addon.py`` starts the
    addon for the duration of its tests, then stops it. Sibling test
    files don't see the addon running.

    ``mcp_server_url`` is pinned to the dev addon's host-network URL so
    the addon-runtime tests don't depend on auto-discovery timing.
    Auto-discovery itself remains in the start.py code path; a dedicated
    test in the haos_only module clears this field, restarts, and
    asserts the discovery log appears.

    Returns the installed slug (``local_ha_mcp_webhook_proxy``).
