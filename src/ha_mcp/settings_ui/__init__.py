        - **addon**: POST the merged options to Supervisor and return
          ``restart_required=True``. ``start.py`` will re-derive env
          vars from ``config.yaml`` on the next addon boot — but the
          actual restart is fired by the user clicking the global
          Restart Add-on button, NOT by this handler. Web UI edits
          and Configuration-tab edits land in the same place, so the
          two surfaces stay in sync after the restart.
        - **env**: refuse — env var explicitly set wins. Returns
          ``VALIDATION_INVALID_PARAMETER`` with the env var name so
          the UI can surface the locking source.
        - **file** / **default**: merge into the override file in the
          data dir; takes effect on the next
          ``get_global_settings()`` call (cache reset). The response
          still carries ``restart_required=True`` because most
          flag descriptions advertise "Requires restart to take
          effect" — the UI shows the banner regardless of mode.

# address 172.30.32.2, so the transport peer the add-on sees is 172.30.32.2 for
# genuine ingress and some other address (a LAN host, the cloudflared tunnel at
