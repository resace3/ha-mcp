"""Persistent localhost settings UI for stdio-mode installations.

Stdio MCP servers (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, default Docker) run as
short-lived subprocesses spawned by the AI client. They idle-die and
get SIGTERM'd by known client bugs, which makes the in-process HTTP
settings page used by the ``ha-mcp-web`` / add-on entrypoints
unreachable when the user wants to open it.

This module addresses that by spawning a tiny standalone Starlette
HTTP server in a detached child process on stdio startup. The child
survives parent SIGTERM / idle-death, lives until the OS reboots (or
until the user disables it), and serves the same settings page the
HTTP modes serve — the route handlers are shared via
:func:`ha_mcp.settings_ui.build_settings_handlers` so there's no second
surface to maintain.

Security posture:
    - Bind 127.0.0.1 only (never the wildcard).
    - Random secret path generated per spawn (16 bytes urlsafe).
    - Random free port chosen at spawn time.
    - ``Host`` header validation: rejects requests whose host doesn't
      match the bound socket — blocks DNS rebinding attacks where a
      malicious website resolves an attacker-controlled domain to
      ``127.0.0.1`` to reach this listener from the user's browser.
    - ``Origin`` validation on mutating methods.
    - ``~/.ha-mcp/ui.{url,pid,log}`` written with 0600 / 0644 perms.

Disable mechanisms:
    - ``HA_MCP_DISABLE_SETTINGS_UI`` env var (truthy → skip spawn).
    - ``~/.ha-mcp/settings_ui_disabled`` sentinel file — created by the
      ``POST /shutdown`` endpoint, honored on next parent startup.

Lifecycle:
    - Parent stdio process calls :func:`maybe_spawn` shortly after
      argument validation, before entering the stdio event loop.
    - Child runs until killed (OS reboot, ``ha-mcp-settings stop``,
      or the ``POST /shutdown`` endpoint).

        DNS rebinding: a malicious site sets up an A record that points
        first at its own IP (passing same-origin checks for the
        attacker page's JS) then re-resolves to 127.0.0.1, so the
        attacker's JS can fetch this listener. The browser still sends
        the attacker's hostname in the ``Host`` header — rejecting any
        Host that isn't 127.0.0.1 / localhost (on the bound port) blocks
        this without touching the network stack.

        CSRF: a malicious page can issue cross-origin POSTs from the
        user's browser. ``Origin`` is set by every modern browser on
        cross-origin requests and is not forgeable from JS — rejecting
        mutating methods whose ``Origin`` doesn't match the listener
        blocks the attack.
