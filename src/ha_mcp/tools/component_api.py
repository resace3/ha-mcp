"""Capability gate for the ``ha_mcp_tools`` custom-component WebSocket API.

The custom component (``custom_components/ha_mcp_tools/``, manifest 1.1.0+)
registers in-process WebSocket commands under the ``ha_mcp_tools/`` namespace
that let the server answer read queries (search, config-get, overview, ...)
from HA's live registries in a single round-trip, instead of the multi-fetch
REST/WS pipelines the server uses today.

Because the component ships over HACS on its own release cadence, a given
install may be at any version — old (no WS surface at all), new (full surface),
or somewhere in between. This module negotiates that with a single cached
``ha_mcp_tools/info`` probe per client:

- ``info`` enumerates the ``capabilities`` the running component actually
  registered. The server checks ``component_supports(caps, "<capability>")``
  before routing a tool through the component, so a capability that a released
  component hasn't shipped yet simply never gets used — no version lockstep.
- If ``info`` itself is ``unknown_command``, the component predates the WS
  surface entirely; caps are cached as ``None`` and every consumer falls back
  to its legacy path.

This mirrors the caller-token cache in ``tools_filesystem.py``: weak-keyed by
client so multi-client / OAuth setups each negotiate independently and the
entry self-evicts when a client is garbage-collected.
