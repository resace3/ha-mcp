"""
Managed YAML configuration editing tools for Home Assistant MCP Server.

Provides a structured, validated tool for editing YAML configuration files
(configuration.yaml and package files) for Home Assistant features that exist
only in YAML and have no REST/WebSocket API equivalent.

**Dependency:** Requires the ha_mcp_tools custom component to be installed.
The tools will gracefully fail with installation instructions if the component is not available.

Feature Flag: Set ENABLE_YAML_CONFIG_EDITING=true to enable.

        **WARNING:** Destructive, disabled by default. Dedicated tools exist for
        almost every use case and should be preferred:

        - Template sensors (state-based or trigger-based) ->
          ha_config_set_helper(helper_type='template')
        - Automations (storage-mode) -> ha_config_set_automation
        - Scripts (storage-mode) -> ha_config_set_script
        - Scenes (storage-mode) -> ha_config_set_scene
        - All 28 helper types (input_*, counter, timer, schedule, zone, person,
          tag, group, min_max, threshold, derivative, statistics, utility_meter,
          trend, filter, switch_as_x, etc.) -> ha_config_set_helper

        Intended for YAML-only integrations with no config-flow or API
        equivalent (command_line, rest, shell_command, notify platforms),
        for integrations with significant YAML-only configuration (knx
        entities in package files), for registering YAML-mode dashboards via
        ``lovelace.dashboards.<url_path>`` (no other ``lovelace.*`` keys),
        and for editing theme files in ``themes/*.yaml`` (keyed by theme name;
        ``frontend.reload_themes`` is triggered automatically so no restart is
        needed). Themes only load when configuration.yaml carries the
        ``frontend: themes:`` include (e.g. ``!include_dir_merge_named themes``);
        this tool cannot add that include (``frontend`` is not an allowed key).
        Also accepts ``automation``, ``script``, and ``scene`` keys when
        ``file`` is a ``packages/*.yaml`` — for git-managed YAML configs
        that track these alongside templates and other YAML items. Writes
        to ``configuration.yaml`` for those three keys remain rejected so
        storage-mode and YAML-mode collections don't collide; use the
        dedicated storage-mode tools instead.
        Check ``post_action`` in the response: most keys need a full HA
        restart. For ``themes/*.yaml`` this tool *performs* the reload itself
        (``frontend.reload_themes``), so ``post_action`` is ``reload_performed``
        (or ``reload_available`` plus ``reload_error`` if that reload failed).
        For template, mqtt, group, automation, script, and scene it only
        *advertises* the reload service (``post_action: reload_available`` with
        a ``reload_service`` to call yourself); the edit is on disk but not yet
        live. Preserves YAML comments and HA tags (``!include``,
        ``!secret``) on round-trip; ``replace`` swaps the subtree as-is.

        Two-step confirmation (default ON, toggle ENABLE_YAML_EDIT_CONFIRM /
        Server Settings): the first call returns ``preview: true`` with a
        unified ``diff`` of exactly what would change on disk and a
        ``confirm_token`` — nothing is written. Review the diff for
        changes outside the requested edit, then repeat the identical
        call adding ``confirm_token`` to apply. Every applied write also
        returns the final ``diff``. A token mismatch means the file
        changed since the preview (or the token was wrong); use the
        freshly returned token.

        ``template-guidelines.md`` ships in this response under ``skill_content``
        by default — YAML packages frequently include
        template sensors / command_line entities / mqtt templates, exactly where
        template misuse causes the subtlest bugs. For deeper routing guidance
        beyond what ships here, use ha_get_skill_guide.
