"""
Backup and restore tools for Home Assistant MCP Server.

Provides the polymorphic ``ha_manage_backup`` tool, which handles both:

* **Full HA snapshots** (``scope="snapshot"``) — the original
  ``ha_backup_create`` / ``ha_backup_restore`` functionality. Heavy
  tarball creation via HA's native backup integration; restore restarts
  HA. Last-resort recovery.
* **Per-edit auto-backups** (``scope="edits"``) — list / view / restore
  / delete operations against the per-entity snapshots produced by the
  ``@with_auto_backup`` decorator (#1288). Lightweight, no HA restart.

The merge consolidates the previous two tools so the LLM cannot
accidentally route "restore my automation" through the heavyweight full
HA restore path. Each call must explicitly pick its scope.

**Pick the scope first**, then the action. Wrong scope routes through the wrong code path:

| scope | action | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `snapshot` | `create` | Create a full HA tarball (config + addons, no DB by default). Heavy, seconds-long. |
| `snapshot` | `list` | List full HA tarball snapshots (id, name, date, size). Read-only — use to discover a `backup_id` or confirm a backup landed. |
| `snapshot` | `restore` | Restore a full HA tarball. **Restarts HA.** Last-resort recovery. |
| `edits` | `create` | On-demand snapshot of one entity (`domain` + `entity_id` required). Use before the user manually edits in the HA UI. Same handler path the decorator takes on writes; bypasses the `enable_auto_backup` toggle. |
| `edits` | `list` | List per-entity auto-backups (lightweight). Filter by `domain` and/or `entity_id`. |
| `edits` | `view` | Read one auto-backup file by name; returns YAML and parsed `config`. |
| `edits` | `diff` | Compare one auto-backup against the entity's current config. RFC 6902 JSON-Patch + add/remove/replace counts; bounded output. Read-only — fetches the live config, makes no changes. |
| `edits` | `restore` | Re-apply one auto-backup. Creates a fresh safety snapshot first. **No HA restart.** |
| `edits` | `delete` | Delete one auto-backup by `backup_name`, or bulk-delete by filter. |

**When to use which scope:**
- Use `scope="edits"` to undo a recent automation/script/scene/dashboard/helper edit by the agent. Lightweight, fast, no restart.
- Use `scope="snapshot"` only for system-wide recovery (botched add-on update, mass config corruption, etc.).

**`scope="snapshot"` backup-hint:**
{backup_hint_text}

**`enable_auto_backup` and `scope="edits"`:** the automatic-on-write capture (every wrapped tool call) is gated by `enable_auto_backup=true` — if the listing is empty, check the toggle (web settings UI or `ENABLE_AUTO_BACKUP=true` env var). The explicit `(edits, create)` action bypasses the toggle since the request is explicit; `list` / `view` / `restore` / `delete` operate on whatever's already on disk regardless of the toggle's current state.

**Examples:**
- Snapshot before risky op: `ha_manage_backup(scope="snapshot", action="create", name="Before_Big_Change")`
- List snapshots (to discover a backup_id or confirm one landed): `ha_manage_backup(scope="snapshot", action="list")`
- Restore full snapshot: `ha_manage_backup(scope="snapshot", action="restore", backup_id="dd7550ed")`
- On-demand entity snapshot before a manual UI edit: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="create", domain="helper_input_boolean", entity_id="kitchen_lights_active")`
- List recent auto-backups for one automation: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="list", domain="automation", entity_id="kitchen_lights")`
- View an auto-backup: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="view", backup_name="automation.kitchen_lights.20260521_153000.yaml")`
- Diff an auto-backup vs current state: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="diff", backup_name="automation.kitchen_lights.20260521_153000.yaml")`
- Restore an auto-backup: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="restore", backup_name="automation.kitchen_lights.20260521_153000.yaml")`
- Delete one auto-backup: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="delete", backup_name="...")`
- Bulk-delete old auto-backups: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="delete", older_than_days=30)`
