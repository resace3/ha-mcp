        Returns ``(homeassistant_scene_uids, slug_to_storage_id, registry_failed)``
        and mutates ``configs`` in place, aliasing each bulk-fetched config under
        its entity-id slug. Two outputs:

        1. ``homeassistant_scene_uids`` -- unique_ids backed by
           ``platform == "homeassistant"`` (HA's storage collection).
           Integration-managed scenes (Hue, IKEA, deCONZ, ...) are entity-only;
           the per-id REST endpoint ``/config/scene/config/<id>`` can't fetch
           them and treating their 404s as ``failed_count`` produces a
           misleading ``partial: true`` flag (issue #1168 R3 blocker 2).
        2. Slug-keyed aliases pointing at the bulk-fetched config. HA derives a
           scene's entity_id from the ``name`` field via its own slugify
           (collapsing runs of underscores, replacing all non-alnum with
           underscores, etc.); approximating that with ``.replace()`` chains
           produces near-misses.

        Run unconditionally so the platform filter is available even when the
        bulk fetch returned nothing (the common Hue-only case).

        Assumption — caveat for downstream callers: when ``registry_failed``
        is ``False``, the returned ``homeassistant_scene_uids`` set is
        assumed to be COMPLETE — every HA-managed scene the registry knows
        about appears in the set. ``_select_scene_ids_to_fetch`` relies on
        this to classify out-of-set UIDs as integration-managed. If HA ever
        returns a successful-but-truncated ``entity_registry/list`` response
        (no current known case), genuinely-HA-managed scenes whose UIDs are
        missing from the response would be misclassified as
        integration-managed and never fetched. Detecting a truncated
        registry response is not generally possible from its shape — the
        function trusts ``success: True`` as a completeness signal.
