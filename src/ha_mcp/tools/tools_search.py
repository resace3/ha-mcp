        """Search for entities (lights, sensors, switches, climate, etc.) by name, domain, or area — AND inside automation/script/scene/helper/dashboard configurations — in one call.

        Two surfaces run in parallel and return tagged results:
          - **entities**: entity-registry matches (entity_id, friendly name,
            area). Filter with `domain_filter`/`area_filter`; omit `query` to
            enumerate a domain/area.
          - **automations / scripts / scenes / helpers / dashboards**: matches
            *inside* config definitions — triggers, actions, sequences, scene
            entity-sets, helper bodies, dashboard cards. Driven by `query`;
            narrow with `search_types`.

        Use this whenever you need to find something in HA without deciding
        entity-name vs config-body search up front.

        When NOT to use:
          - To read a known entity_id's state: use `ha_get_state` (cheaper).
          - To inspect one automation/script/scene config by id: use the
            matching `ha_config_get_*`.
          - To list installed add-ons: use `ha_get_addon`.

        Config-body search is skipped when `domain_filter`/`area_filter`/
        `state_filter` signal entity-only intent (keeping name lookups off the
        expensive backend); a `warnings[]` entry names the skip. Pass
        `search_types=[...]` to force config search.

        Caveats:
          - `partial: True` means results are NOT exhaustive — a surface raised,
            or the config-body branch lost data (per-id time budget exhausted,
            an individual fetch failed, or a helper-type list fetch failed).
            Empty buckets with `partial: True` mean "search failed", not "no
            results". The cause is in `partial_reason`, also mirrored into
            `warnings[]` with an "incomplete results: " prefix. Do not treat a
            partial response as complete.
          - `count` is items in this response (post-pagination), not corpus
            totals — use `entity_total_matches` + `config_total_matches`.
          - `limit`/`offset` apply per-surface. Flat `has_more`/`next_offset`
            page the next call (iterate `offset = next_offset`); per-surface
            `entity_*`/`config_*` variants show which surface still has results.

        Examples:
            - List sensors in an area: ha_search(domain_filter="sensor", area_filter="Living Room")
            - Find a light by name: ha_search("kitchen", domain_filter="light")
            - Which automations use an entity: ha_search("light.bed_light")
            - Scenes touching a light: ha_search("light.kitchen", search_types=["scene"])
            - Narrow the response to the entity bucket: ha_search("kitchen", fields=["entities"])

        Returns comprehensive system information at the requested detail level,
        including Home Assistant base_url, version, location, timezone, entity overview,
        and active persistent notifications (if any).
        Use 'minimal' (default) for most queries. Domain counts and states_summary
        are always complete regardless of entity pagination.
        Standard/full modes paginate entities (default 200 per page) — use offset
        to fetch more. Use 'domains' filter to narrow scope.

        Use fields= to project the response to only the keys you need — a
        significantly smaller payload when fetching a single sub-section (e.g.
        fields=["system_info"] returns just that section instead of the full overview).

        When (and only when) the ha-mcp settings-UI sidecar is running
        (stdio mode, e.g. Claude Desktop / Claude Code), the response
        includes a ``settings_url`` field — the local URL to the
        tool-configuration page. Hand this URL to the user when they
        ask how to enable or disable tools or change server settings.
        ``settings_url`` is emitted regardless of ``fields=``
        projection (so it stays discoverable even when callers
        minimize the response) but only when the sidecar URL file
        actually exists.

        In HTTP / Docker / OAuth modes there is no sidecar URL file and the
        server can't know its externally reachable host, so the response
        instead carries a ``settings_url_hint`` string telling the user where
        the page is mounted and to read the full URL from the startup logs.
        Hand whichever of the two fields is present to the user.

        The response also carries an ``ha_mcp_update`` object
        ``{current, latest, update_available}`` reporting whether a newer ha-mcp
        release is available (PyPI for pip/Docker, the Supervisor add-on store
        for the add-on) — proactively tell the user when ``update_available`` is
        true. Emitted regardless of ``fields=``; omitted only for the
        ``unknown`` version and when ``HA_MCP_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK`` is set.

        call a specific service, which scenes set a particular entity, or any config that contains
        a certain action). For finding entity IDs by name, use ha_search instead.

        Searches within configuration definitions including triggers, actions, sequences, scene
        entity sets, and other config fields. Also searches dashboard configurations (cards,
        badges, views) when search_types includes 'dashboard'.

        **NOTE:** Dashboards and badges are NOT searched by default. Add 'dashboard' to
        search_types to include them.

        The 'helper' search covers both input_* helpers (input_boolean, input_number, ...)
        and UI-created flow-based helpers (template, group, utility_meter, derivative, ...).
        For flow-helpers, results carry the parent config entry id under ``entry_id``.
        When ``include_config=False`` (the default), pair with
        ``ha_get_integration(entry_id=..., include_options=True)`` to retrieve the full
        config; set ``include_config=True`` to get it inline in one call.

        Pass a string entity_id. Returns the entity's full state and attributes.

        MULTIPLE ENTITIES:
        Pass a list of entity IDs (max 100). Efficiently retrieves states using
        parallel requests. Duplicates are automatically deduplicated.
        Returns success=True if at least one entity state was retrieved.
        Check 'error_count' for any failed lookups in partial-success scenarios.

        FIELDS PROJECTION:
        `fields=` projects the per-entity record keys (see the fields= parameter
        description for the full key list), NOT the outer bulk response wrapper.
        In single-entity mode it filters keys of the returned record directly. In bulk
        mode it filters keys of each record inside `states[entity_id]`; outer keys
        (`success`, `count`, `states`, `errors`, ...) are always preserved.
        `attribute_keys=` further narrows the `attributes` sub-dict and is only applied
        when `"attributes"` is in `fields=` (or `fields=None`); otherwise it is a no-op.

        When `attribute_keys=` is set but has no effect (because `attributes` was
        excluded by `fields=`), a `warnings` list is emitted outside the projected
        entity record(s): in bulk mode at the response wrapper level (sibling of
        `success`/`count`/`states`); in single-entity mode at the top-level result
        (sibling of `data`/`metadata`, since the projected record IS `data`).
        The warnings list is never a record key, so `fields=["state"]` returns a
        record with only `state` regardless of whether the no-effect warning fires.
