    notes (degraded registry, dropped unknown categories, an empty-registry
    allowlist degradation, missing Assist data) for the caller to surface at the
    response level.

    ``states_result`` (the live states list the seam already holds) is used for
    two things when provided: it widens the allowlist and Assist dimensions to
    states-only entities (YAML/template entities absent from the registry), and
    it supplies the effective ``device_class`` (HA reads it from the live entity,
    not the registry) for the Assist default-exposure check. Without it, both
    dimensions degrade to registry-only.

    ``device_registry_result`` (``config/device_registry/list``) supplies the
    device area/labels an entity inherits: HA resolves an entity's effective area
    as its own ``area_id`` falling back to its device's, and a device's labels
    apply to its entities. The area/label exclude and allow dimensions match on
    that effective area/labels, so a device-bound entity (registry ``area_id``
    None + a ``device_id``) is filtered by its device's area/labels. Without the
    payload those dimensions fall back to entity-level matching only, which misses
    device-bound entities (most real ones).

    This is a pure function. For the Assist dimension, a registry entry's explicit
    ``conversation`` ``should_expose`` (True *or* False) is read directly from the
    entry ``options`` in this payload (``config/entity_registry/list`` already
    carries ``options``). ``assist_overrides`` supplies the True-only exposures
    ``load_hidden_set`` reads from ``homeassistant/expose_entity/list`` — the only
    exposure source for states-only entities with no registry entry — and
    ``expose_new`` is HA's "expose new entities" flag. Note the ha-mcp visibility
    precedence (a conjunction of hide dimensions) is separate from HA's own
    async_should_expose precedence, which only the Assist dimension mirrors.
