"""Load skill reference files from the bundled skills-vendor directory.

Shared helper for the consolidated ``ha_get_skill_guide`` tool and the
write-tool ``MandatoryBPS`` parameter. Mirrors the symlink + path-traversal
guards in ``server.py::_handle_skill_guide_call`` so any caller that needs to
read a ``(skill, file)`` pair gets the same safety contract.

Functions:

* :func:`get_skills_dir` — returns the on-disk skills root when the vendor
  submodule is present, else ``None``.
* :func:`resolve_skill_files` — reads N file refs from one skill and returns
  ``{ref: body_or_section}``. Each ref is either a bare file path
  (``"references/X.md"``) or a path with an anchor
  (``"references/X.md#native-conditions"``); anchored refs yield just the
  matching markdown section so reactive embeds don't ship 20 KB when only
  one 2 KB section is relevant. A top-level ``#`` anchor or a section
  near EOF will return most of the file — the section runs from the
  matching heading to the next same/higher-level heading. Silently skips
  missing files, missing anchors, symlinks, and path-traversal attempts.
* :func:`extract_section` — markdown heading-based slicer used by
  ``resolve_skill_files`` and exposed for callers that already have a file
  body in hand.

The silent-skip contract is deliberate. Callers (write tools) attach the
returned dict to a ``skill_content`` response field. A missing reference
should never fail the surrounding write operation — the agent still gets
any warnings plus whatever files did resolve. The strict-error path stays
with ``_handle_skill_guide_call``, which must raise ``ToolError`` for the
explicit user-requested file lookup.
