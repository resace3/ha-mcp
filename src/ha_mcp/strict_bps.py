"""Strict mandatory best-practices gate (#1779).

Today the six write tools attach best-practice ``skill_content`` unless
the caller passes ``MandatoryBPS=false`` — purely advisory. This module
adds a HARD GATE modeled on the Hubitat MCP server's acknowledgment gate:
when strict mode is effective, those six write tools are BLOCKED unless
the call carries an acknowledgment key that is published ONLY inside the
best-practices skill content served by ``ha_get_skill_guide``. The block
error tells the model exactly how to obtain the key but never the key
itself, forcing it to actually fetch/read the best practices before
writing.

Strict mode is *effective* only when BOTH ``enable_mandatory_bps`` (the
parent, #1182) and ``enable_strict_mandatory_bps`` (the child, #1779) are
on — see :func:`strict_bps_effective`. Both flags are read live per
request, mirroring ``read_only_mode``: a settings-UI toggle applies live
when the UI shares the server process (standalone HTTP / embedded);
other modes pick the change up on restart.

The six write tools declare the ``BestPracticeKey`` parameter on their
signatures purely so FastMCP's pydantic validation accepts it and
schema-validating clients will send it; the tool bodies never read it —
:class:`StrictBpsMiddleware` consumes it here at call time.
