"""Run the ha-mcp FastMCP server in-process inside Home Assistant (issue #1527).

The :class:`EmbeddedServerManager` owns the full lifecycle of the in-process
ha-mcp server:

* ensures the ``ha-mcp`` package is importable (runtime pip install via
  Home Assistant's requirements manager, honoring an options-flow pip-spec
  override for pre-release testing, and forcing a real reinstall when that spec
  changes),
* provisions a long-lived Home Assistant admin token the server uses to reach HA
  core over loopback (REST + WebSocket),
* runs the server on a dedicated thread with its own asyncio loop — uvicorn
  skips signal capture off the main thread and a heavy tool can never stall HA's
  event loop — and
* tears the thread down cleanly, and revokes the provisioned credentials when
  the entry is removed.

Everything the server needs from ha-mcp is imported **inside the worker thread**,
after the required non-secret environment variables are staged, so importing this
module never pulls in ``ha_mcp`` (which may not be installed yet) and never runs
before the connection is in place. The loopback URL and the admin token are handed
to ha-mcp **in memory** via ``ha_mcp.config.set_embedded_connection`` — never
through ``os.environ`` — so the admin token can never be read from the shared HA
process environment. ``ha_mcp`` module-level imports are therefore forbidden here.
